# Raycast Script: Regular Window Size

A Swift/AppleScript script for [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) that moves your frontmost application
window to the center of the screen, applies a 5/4 aspect ratio to it and gives
it some padding.

## How to activate

Get the Swift file somehow, then go to _Raycast preferences > Extensions >
Script Commands_ and add the directory with your Swift file in the right
sidebar.
